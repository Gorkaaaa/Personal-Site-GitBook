## **BlackBoxer Script Documentation**

### **Overview**

**BlackBoxer** is a Bash script designed to automate port enumeration and scanning tasks for domains associated with a **bug bounty program**. It resolves domains to IP addresses, performs TCP and UDP scans, and organizes results in a structured, user-friendly format.

***

### **Usage**

#### **Command Syntax**

```bash
./BlackBoxer.sh [BUG_BOUNTY_PROGRAM_NAME]
```

#### **Input Parameters**

* **BUG\_BOUNTY\_PROGRAM\_NAME**: The name of the bug bounty program, used to create a results directory.

#### **Prerequisites**

1.  **Install nmap**:\
    Ensure `nmap` is installed. If not, run:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nmap
    ```
2.  **Create valid\_domains.txt**:\
    A file containing the domains to scan, one per line:

    ```plaintext
    example.com
    subdomain.example.com
    anotherdomain.com
    ```

***

### **Execution Flow**

#### **1. Input Validation**

* Verifies that the program name is provided.
* Ensures `valid_domains.txt` exists in the current directory.

#### **2. Results Directory Creation**

* A directory named `[BUG_BOUNTY_PROGRAM_NAME]_results` is created to store outputs.

#### **3. Domain-to-IP Resolution**

* Resolves each domain from `valid_domains.txt` to its public IP address using the `dig` command.
* Skips:
  * Domains that cannot be resolved.
  * Duplicate IPs already processed.

#### **4. TCP and UDP Port Scanning**

* For each unique IP:
  * **TCP Scan**:
    * Scans all ports (`-p-`) using `nmap` with SYN scan (`-sS`).
    * Optimizes the scan with a minimum packet rate (`--min-rate 500`).
    * Saves results in `tcp_scan.txt`.
  * **UDP Scan**:
    * Scans the 150 most common UDP ports.
    * Saves results in `udp_scan.txt`.
* Results are formatted and saved in subdirectories for each IP.

#### **5. User-Friendly Output**

* Uses color-coded messages for better readability:
  * **Cyan**: General process updates.
  * **Yellow**: Warnings (e.g., unresolved domains or duplicate IPs).
  * **Green**: Success messages and results.

#### **6. Final Results**

* Results are saved in `[BUG_BOUNTY_PROGRAM_NAME]_results` directory:
  * `tcp_scan.txt`: Open TCP ports.
  * `udp_scan.txt`: Open UDP ports.

***

### **Example Usage**

1.  **Prepare the Domains File**:\
    Create a file `valid_domains.txt` with the following content:

    ```plaintext
    example.com
    subdomain.example.com
    anotherdomain.com
    ```

2.  **Run the Script**:\
    Execute the script with the desired program name:

    ```bash
    ./BlackBoxer.sh TestProgram
    ```
3.  **Example Output**:\
    Console output will look like this:

    ```plaintext
    [+] Processing domains from 'valid_domains.txt'...
    [+] Resolving domain: example.com
    [+] Scanning TCP on 93.184.216.34...
        Open TCP ports found on 93.184.216.34:
        80/tcp  open  http
        443/tcp open  https
    [+] Scanning UDP on 93.184.216.34...
        No open UDP ports found on 93.184.216.34.
    ```

***

### **Benefits**

* **Automation**: Significantly reduces manual effort for port enumeration.
* **Efficiency**: Avoids duplicate processing of IPs.
* **Organization**: Results are structured in directories and files for easy analysis.
* **Scalability**: Easily extendable to include additional tools or functionality.

***

### **Next Steps**

* To enhance the script, consider integrating additional tools like `httpx` or `subfinder` for more comprehensive scanning.
* Feel free to modify the color schemes or extend functionality based on your workflow.
