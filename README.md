# 🌃 Welcome

Hello, my name is Gorka, I am a student of microcomputer systems at a high school in Barcelona, ​​I am very passionate about cybersecurity and I am currently almost a month away from taking the OSCP exam. \
\
I always try to learn about everything and share everything I do with the community. It is very important for me to see a result from each area of ​​cybersecurity that I specialize in, therefore I always try to look for certifications or titles that corroborate the knowledge I have been fighting for.\
\
I am really excited to share my content with you and be able to contribute my grain of sand to the community.

I have a large knowledge base in cybersecurity and I complement it with full stack knowledge in programming using react, mongodb and node JS and also more oriented to cybersecurity I master python and bash.
