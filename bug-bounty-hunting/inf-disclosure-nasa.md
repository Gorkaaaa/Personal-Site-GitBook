# ü™ñ Inf Disclosure üöÄNASA

**Description:**

A critical information disclosure vulnerability has been identified on the nasa.gov domain. Using Google Dorking techniques, it was possible to access a PDF document labeled as ‚Äúconfidential.‚Äù This file contains over 100 pages of sensitive conversations related to a NASA space mission.

The document is publicly accessible at the following URL:

\[REDACTED]

Each page of the document is marked as ‚ÄúConfidential,‚Äù confirming the leak of sensitive information. There is no indication that the document has been declassified.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a web browser and go to Google.
2. Enter the following Google Dorking query in the search bar:

```
site:nasa.gov ext:pdf inurl:"GT-3" inurl:"mission_trans"
```

2.  Review the search results and click on the link leading to the document.

3. Download or view the document to confirm its confidentiality markings.
4. Validate that each page is labeled as ‚ÄúConfidential‚Äù and that no declassification notice is present.

### Potential Impact

An attacker with access to this document could:

* Obtain sensitive information about a NASA space mission.
* Expose internal communications.
* Compromise national security if the document contains information about advanced technologies or critical procedures.
* Use the information in intelligence or espionage operations.
* Leak the document to malicious actors for sabotage or data exploitation.

### Mitigation Recommendations 

To prevent such vulnerabilities, the following actions are recommended:

1. Remove the file from public access or restrict access via authentication.
2. Configure the robots.txt file to prevent search engines from indexing sensitive documents.
3. Conduct periodic audits of publicly accessible content to identify and mitigate classified information leaks.
4. Apply encryption to confidential documents and ensure that only authorized personnel can access them.
5. Monitor for unusual access patterns and queries that may indicate Google Dorking attempts against NASA servers.

### Conclusion

The exposure of NASA documents via Google Dorking represents a critical vulnerability that must be addressed urgently. The information contained in these documents can be exploited by malicious actors, jeopardizing the security of NASA operations and space missions. Immediate mitigation measures are required to protect the integrity and confidentiality of NASA‚Äôs data.
