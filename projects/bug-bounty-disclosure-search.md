## DisclosureSearch

> **A comprehensive Bug Bounty helper for discovering information disclosure.**

### Overview

**DisclosureSearch** is a multi-threaded, automated scanning tool to find **information disclosure** across multiple subdomains. It integrates with [**Katana**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana) to gather a large set of possible paths for each subdomain and then performs a **BFS crawl** internally to discover additional URLs and look for secrets using **extensive regex checks**.

***

### Features

1. **Katana Integration**
   * Automatically triggers Katana against each target to fetch potential endpoints with a high level of depth and concurrency.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Crawler**
   * Recursively crawls discovered pages to a configurable depth (`-d, --depth`) and collects new links that match the same domain.
3. **Multi-Threading**
   * Executes scans concurrently using Pythonâ€™s `ThreadPoolExecutor`, greatly speeding up scanning on large lists of subdomains.
4. **Diverse Regex Detection**
   * Matches AWS keys, Google API keys, potential credentials, session tokens, Slack tokens, internal IPs, MD5/SHA1/SHA256/Bcrypt hashes, private SSH keys, etc.
5. **Clear & Colorful CLI Output**
   * Prints progress messages, warnings, and errors with color-coded logs (via [**Colorama**](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)).
6. **Comprehensive Reporting**
   * Generates a **clean text report** (default `disclosures.txt`) containing all detected disclosures per subdomain.

***

### Installation

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Make sure you have Katana installed and available in your PATH:

```bash
go install github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/cmd/katana@latest
```

3.  **Run**:

    ```bash
     python3 disclosure_search.py -s subdomains.txt -o disclosures_report.txt
    ```

## Usage

```bash
python3 disclosure_search.py \
    -s /path/to/subdomains.txt \
    -o /path/to/output.txt \
    -w 20 \
    -d 3
```

Argument Description Default -s, --subdomains File with subdomains to scan (one per line). Required -o, --output File to store the final disclosure report. disclosures.txt -w, --workers Number of worker threads for concurrency. 10 -d, --depth BFS Depth for internal crawling of found URLs. 2

## Example Workflow

1. Prepare your subdomain file subdomains.txt

```
sub1.example.com
sub2.example.com
api.example.com
...
```

2. **Execute DisclosureSearch**

```bash
python3 disclosure_search.py -s subdomains.txt -o found_disclosures.txt -w 20 -d 3
```

3. **Monitor CLI logs:**

* See the colorful messages that show each subdomain scan, BFS progress, and any errors.

4. Check your report:

* All findings (AWS Keys, tokens, hashed passwords, etc.) are listed inside found\_disclosures.txt.

## Important Notes

* Intended Use: This tool aims to support authorized bug bounty or penetration testing programs.
* Performance Caution: High BFS depth + large subdomain lists can produce heavy load. Tweak -w (workers) and -d (depth) accordingly.
* False Positives: Because the regex set is extremely broad, some false positives are inevitable. Always verify findings manually.
* Legal Warning: Use responsibly and with explicit permission. Unauthorized scanning of systems is illegal and unethical.
